# Development

## Deployment

1. Update `package.json` appropriately with SemVer
2. Update `package-lock.json` with same version
3. Commit changes; use version number as commit message
4. Create tag for commit
5. Publish to NPM with `npm publish` (or `npm publish -f` if you run in trouble)

⚠️ Do not use the `np` package anymore it requires too many useless changes to this simple style library.
